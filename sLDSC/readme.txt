to calculate LD score, run Step1 for EUR and EAS populations. 
to compute tau and enrichment for each annotation, run Step2 for EUR and EAS populations. 
to run S-LDSC for all 42 traits, replace RA.EUR.trait.path.txt with 42_traits.paths.txt (note: these summary statistics are only for EUR population)
